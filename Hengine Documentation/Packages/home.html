		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<p>
			When using the Hengine, different projects are separated into folder structures called Packages. 
			Packages contain the Environment required to properly use the Hengine. 
			The Package is where your sprites, animations, sounds, and source code are stored.
			The Hengine itself is not stored inside the Package.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Structure</h3>
		<p>
			Packages only work if they have the correct structure.
			For <a href="../Project/home.html">Project</a>.loadImage and Project.loadSound to work, the Package's files have to be the correct locations.
			<br>Anatomy of a Hengine Package:
			<br><br><pre class="mono">
				packageName*─┬──Source─┬──Source.js
				             │         ├──Set List.js
				             │         ├──Scripts.js
				             │         ├──Project.html
				             │         └──Offline Project.html
				             │
				             ├──Sound─┬──SoundFile.mp3**
				             │        └──SoundFile2.mp3**

					* This can be whatever you like. If you never use <a href="../Engine/home.html">Engine</a>.setTitle, then this will be the title of the page.<br>
					** These can be any sound files with any names and extensions.<br>
					*** These can be any image files with any names and extensions.<br>
					**** This folder represents your animations. You can have any number of these and they can have any names.<br>
					***** These are the frames in your animation. They have to be named according to their frame number and the must be .pngs.<br>
				</p>
			</span>
			<p>
				The Default Package starts with 'Chicken.png' in the Sprites folder and a 'Chicken Flap' animation in the Animations folder.
				All of your Hengine Packages should be stored inside of a 'Packages' Folder.
			</p>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Project.html &amp; OfflineProject.html</h3>
		<p>
			Project.html and OfflineProject.html are the HTML files can be opened to actually run your project.
			These files can be found in the Source folder of your Package.
			Project.html needs an internet connection to run, because it needs to access the Engine.
			OfflineProject.html does not need an internet connection but it will only run with the version of Hengine available when you first downloaded the package.
			Now, you can use OfflineProject.html to run your game on your computer. <br>
			Project.html and OfflineProject.html have a similar structure:
			<ul>
				<li class="method">
					<h2>Rendering</h2>
					<p>
						This section contains the two scripts used for rendering, 'Canvas Complete.js' and 'Color.js'
					</p>
				</li>
				<li class="method">
					<h2>Optional</h2>
					<p>
						This contains the optional scripts:
						<ul>
							<li class="method2">
								<h2>Helper Functions.js</h2>
								<p>
									Enables the <a href="../Function Library/home.html">FunctionLibrary</a> class.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li class="method">
					<h2>Required</h2>
					<p>
						The rest of the required pieces of the Engine.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You can comment out the scripts in the optional section to make load times faster, and you can enable them again to get the additional classes.
				For offline and online, the Launch.html files are mostly blank html files that have the game embedded in them. 
				These can be used for making webpages with the Game inside.
